What does the justify-content property do? 
TODO: Write your answer here 
It defines the alignment along the main axis. 
It helps distribute extra free space leftover when 
either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, 
or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. 
It also exerts some control over the alignment of 
items when they overflow the line.

/* 
What is the flex property a shorthand property for?
The flex CSS shorthand property is the combination of flex-grow, 
flex-shrink, and flex-basis property. It is used to set the length 
of flexible items. The flex property is much responsive and 
mobile-friendly. It is easy to position child elements and the 
main container. The margin doesnâ€™t collapse with the content margins. 
The order of any element can be easily changed without 
editing the HTML section.

What is it doing here? 
Setting flex not growable not shrinkable and setting the min size/flex basis property.

What does the flex-direction property define?
The flex-direction CSS property sets how flex items are placed

 What is it doing here? 
 Setting it to column style
